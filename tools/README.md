`hf_forced_alignment_tutorial.ipynb` can be used to validate [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) or [Torch Pipeline](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/pipelines.html) models for Forced Alignment use.

If using a `Hugging Face` model, make sure `use_hf` is set to `True`. And set the rest of the variables accordingly.
